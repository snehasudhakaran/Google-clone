Front-End technologies – HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACT.JS are used.
Deployment of a project using FIREBASE

Technologies Used:
1.	HTML - It is used to structure and present information on web pages. It provides a standardized way to mark up content, making it accessible, well-organized, and easily understood by web browsers and search engine crawlers, allowing Google to index and display search results effectively.

2.	CSS - CSS is the primary technology for styling and formatting web pages. It allows developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual presentation of HTML elements.

3.	JavaScript - It is utilized in websites to perform dynamic tasks, such as fetching data from servers and executing actions in real-time, enhancing the interactivity and responsiveness of the user experience.

4.	React - React simplifies UI development through reusable components and a declarative approach, optimizing performance with a virtual DOM.

5.	Firebase hosting – It is a web hosting service provided by Google Firebase, offering developers a simple and efficient way to deploy and host web applications, static content, and dynamic content.

Steps to create search engine:
•	To create a react app, the command “npx create-react-app google-clone” was employed.
•	I’ve developed a layout for the homepage and search results page of a Google search engine using HTML and CSS.
•	Developed essential components for the application, including SearchBar, SearchResults, and SearchResultItem.
•	I've crafted functional components for each UI element, ensuring modularity and well-commented code.
•	The responsiveness of the Google search engine has been accomplished through the use of CSS.
•	Routing is implemented using the react-router-dom library in React.



Context API
•	Context API in React is employed to efficiently manage and propagate data, such as API responses, throughout various components in a React application, providing a centralized and organized approach to handling and sharing this external data within the component tree.
•	Utilized the Search engine Id (CONTEXT_KEY) from https://cse.google.com/cse/create/new and API_KEY from https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction#identify_your_application_to_google_with_api_key   to establish a Custom Search Engine (CSE) using Google Custom Search. This platform empowers users to craft a personalized search engine that is specifically designed for particular websites, subjects, or areas of interest.
•	Retrieved data using the Fetch API with the context API ID and app key and displayed in Google search result page.
